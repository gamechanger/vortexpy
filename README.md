Vortex is a light weight framework built on Tornado for building efficient live-updating web interfaces.

Right now it's just an idea, so what follows will have to suffice for a plan:

* a JSON-based web server
* a facility for interacting with templates on both server- and client-side
* flexibly cacheing generated content, with an eye toward versioning & caches
